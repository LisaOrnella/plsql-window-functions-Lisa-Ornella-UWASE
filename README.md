**5 measurable goals:**

Goal 2: Calculate the total sales amount for each month and keep a cumulative running total

Goal 3: Measure the percentage change in total sales from the previous month to the current month.

Goal 4: Divide all customers into 4 groups based on total spending in the past 12 months (top 25%, next 25%, etc)

Goal 5: Compute the average sales for each 3-month period to observe trends over time.
